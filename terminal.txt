WHERE ARE MY SLIPPERS? AH, HERE THEY ARE. YOU KNOW, POLAR BEARS
DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM KEEPING WARM
LIKE WE DO. THEY'RE EQUIPPED WITH FUR
AND LAYERS OF FAT SO THEY CAN SWIM AND HUNT
IN ICY COLD ARTIC WATERS. THEY CAN EVEN STAY UNDER WATER
FOR AS LONG AS TWO MINUTES AND HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO
SWIM FOR 200 MILES IN A SINGLE STRETCH. ONE FEMALE POLAR BEAR

CAN SMELL THEIR PREY, SEALS THAT ARE

OF POLAR BEARS AS BEING WHITE, BUT THEIR FUR IS
ACTUALLY TRANSPARENT. HOW COOL IS THAT? THEY TOTALLY BLEND INTO

POLAR BEARS HAVE BELLYBUTTONS? I WONDER IF THEY GET LINT

MELT AND POLAR BEARS MAY DISAPPEAR ALONG WITH IT. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ABOUT
25,000 POLAR BEARS LIVING IN THE
ARCTIC REGION, RESEARCHERS PREDICT
THAT IN 50 YEARS, TWO-THIRDS OF
THEM WILL BE GONE. NOT JUST BECAUSE

LEO: HEY DAD,
WHERE ARE MY SLIPPERS? AH, HERE THEY ARE. YOU KNOW, POLAR BEARS
DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM KEEPING WARM
LIKE WE DO. THEY'RE EQUIPPED WITH FUR
AND LAYERS OF FAT SO THEY CAN SWIM AND HUNT
IN ICY COLD ARTIC WATERS. THEY CAN EVEN STAY UNDER WATER
FOR AS LONG AS TWO MINUTES AND HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO
SWIM FOR 200 MILES IN A SINGLE STRETCH. ONE FEMALE POLAR BEAR
WAS TRACKED SWIMMING FOR 9 DAYS STRAIGHT,
SHE DESERVES A MEDAL! SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE
POLAR BEARS GOING FOR A RIDE ON THE ICE... AS THEY FLOAT ALONG THEY
CAN SMELL THEIR PREY, SEALS THAT ARE
SWIMMING BENEATH. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE WE THINK
OF POLAR BEARS AS BEING WHITE, BUT THEIR FUR IS
ACTUALLY TRANSPARENT. HOW COOL IS THAT? THEY TOTALLY BLEND INTO
THEIR SURROUNDINGS. OH AND DID YOU KNOW THAT
POLAR BEARS HAVE BELLYBUTTONS? I WONDER IF THEY GET LINT
TRAPPED IN THERE TOO? BUT BECAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING,
MORE AND MORE OF THE ARCTIC ICE IS STARTING TO
MELT AND POLAR BEARS MAY DISAPPEAR ALONG WITH IT. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ABOUT
25,000 POLAR BEARS LIVING IN THE
ARCTIC REGION, RESEARCHERS PREDICT
THAT IN 50 YEARS, TWO-THIRDS OF
THEM WILL BE GONE. NOT JUST BECAUSE
OF GLOBAL WARMING, BUT ALSO BECAUSE
OF OIL DRILLING, POLLUTION AND HUNTING. POLAR BEARS ARE ACTUALLY
CONSIDERED MARINE MAMMALS LIKE SEALS AND WHALES
BECAUSE THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON THE SEA FOR THEIR FOOD. THEY'RE A CRUCIAL PART
OF THE ARCTIC ECOSYSTEM. THE HEALTH OF THEIR POPULATION
INDICATES THE HEALTH OF THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM,
GOOD OR BAD. MANY OF THE 21,000 SPECIES
WHO LIVE IN THE ARCTIC WOULD BE EFFECTED BY THE
LOSS OF THE POLAR BEAR. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS
THAT WE CAN DO THINGS, LIKE RIGHT THIS MINUTE
THAT WILL HELP SAVE THE POLAR BEARS IN
A VERY REAL WAY. YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO
LEAVE YOUR HOUSE TO DO IT. SAVING ENERGY AND PROTECTING
THE ENVIRONMENT CAN HELP SLOW DOWN AND MAYBE
EVEN STOP GLOBAL WARMING. MY FRIENDS AND I STARTED
A CLUB CALLED "THE SCREAMING GREENIES"
WHERE WE SHARE IDEAS, DO COMMUNITY PROJECTS AND TAKE
A PLEDGE TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO HELP SAVE THE PLANET
AND THE POLAR BEARS. LAST WEEK WE MADE A POLAR
BEAR COOKBOOK TO SELL. ALL OF THE MONEY WE RAISE WILL
GO TOWARDS A FOUNDATION THAT'S HELPING TO SAVE
THE POLAR BEARS. NO, WE AREN'T COOKING POLAR
BEARS OR EVEN EATING LIKE POLAR BEARS, WALRUS PIZZA
AND NARWHAL FRIES ANYONE? IT'S ALL ABOUT CHOOSING
HEALTHY FOODS THAT ARE LOCALLY GROWN,
MINIMALLY PROCESSED AND DON'T REQUIRE A LOT
OF ENERGY TO COOK. NOW, I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT
I'M NOT MUCH OF A COOK, BUT I DO LOVE TO DRAW. I CALL THIS ONE,

LEO: HEY DAD,
WHERE ARE MY SLIPPERS? AH, HERE THEY ARE. YOU KNOW, POLAR BEARS
DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM KEEPING WARM
LIKE WE DO. THEY'RE EQUIPPED WITH FUR
AND LAYERS OF FAT SO THEY CAN SWIM AND HUNT
IN ICY COLD ARTIC WATERS. THEY CAN EVEN STAY UNDER WATER
FOR AS LONG AS TWO MINUTES AND HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO
SWIM FOR 200 MILES IN A SINGLE STRETCH. ONE FEMALE POLAR BEAR
WAS TRACKED SWIMMING FOR 9 DAYS STRAIGHT,
SHE DESERVES A MEDAL! SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE
POLAR BEARS GOING FOR A RIDE ON THE ICE... AS THEY FLOAT ALONG THEY
CAN SMELL THEIR PREY, SEALS THAT ARE
SWIMMING BENEATH. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE WE THINK
OF POLAR BEARS AS BEING WHITE, BUT THEIR FUR IS
ACTUALLY TRANSPARENT. HOW COOL IS THAT? THEY TOTALLY BLEND INTO
THEIR SURROUNDINGS. OH AND DID YOU KNOW THAT
POLAR BEARS HAVE BELLYBUTTONS? I WONDER IF THEY GET LINT
TRAPPED IN THERE TOO? BUT BECAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING,
MORE AND MORE OF THE ARCTIC ICE IS STARTING TO
MELT AND POLAR BEARS MAY DISAPPEAR ALONG WITH IT. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ABOUT
25,000 POLAR BEARS LIVING IN THE
ARCTIC REGION, RESEARCHERS PREDICT
THAT IN 50 YEARS, TWO-THIRDS OF
THEM WILL BE GONE. NOT JUST BECAUSE
OF GLOBAL WARMING, BUT ALSO BECAUSE
OF OIL DRILLING, POLLUTION AND HUNTING. POLAR BEARS ARE ACTUALLY
CONSIDERED MARINE MAMMALS LIKE SEALS AND WHALES
BECAUSE THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON THE SEA FOR THEIR FOOD. THEY'RE A CRUCIAL PART
OF THE ARCTIC ECOSYSTEM. THE HEALTH OF THEIR POPULATION
INDICATES THE HEALTH OF THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM,

[Music] Bears have an acute sense of smell they can detect seals from nearly 2 miles this one's closer [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] news of her kill carries on the wind a huge male he needs food too and he doesn't care how he gets it [Music] just bones she's taken her fill now she must leave a hungry male polar bear can turn [Applause] cannibal summer in the poles has always been a time of transformation but now the Arctic is changing faster than at any rate in recorded history the climate is warming [Music] polar bears face immediate survival choices head deeper into the ice or Swim full land either way four lean months lie [Music] ahead climate change at the poles will bring challenges for many but for some it's opportunity over 50 years the average temperature here has risen by around 5° F gen two penguins like it warmer than the ice loving Emperor [Music] cousins it exposes the bare rock they need for nesting the waters here are so rich successfully raising two chicks is far more [Music] likely who feed first is decided by a Chase [Music] [Music] chicks are at all stages the oldest are ready for the sea but their first taste of the ocean may also be their last a changing climate around Antarctica is helping Gen 2 penguin populations but even in summer conditions can deteriorate rapidly storms blow Brash ice into Shore the route back to the Colony is blocked fledglings must negotiate a maze of floating ice it's all too easy to get left behind and that's not the only [Music] danger pushing through Brash ice is hard work but this is not a safe place to rest

Observation: Page: Polar bear
Summary: The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas. It is closely related to the brown bear, and the two species can interbreed. The polar bear is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). The species is sexually dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller. The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.
Polar bears are both terrestrial and pagophilic (ice-living) and are considered marine mammals because of their dependence on marine ecosystems. They prefer the annual sea ice but live on land when the ice melts in the summer. They are mostly carnivorous and specialized for preying on seals, particularly ringed seals. Such prey is typically taken by ambush; the bear may stalk its prey on the ice or in the water, but also will stay at a breathing hole or ice edge to wait for prey to swim by. The bear primarily feeds on the seal's energy-rich blubber. Other prey include walruses, beluga whales and some terrestrial animals. Polar bears are usually solitary but can be found in groups when on land. During the breeding season, male bears guard females and defend them from rivals. Mothers give birth to cubs in maternity dens during the winter. Young stay with their mother for up to two and a half years.
The polar bear is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with an estimated total population of 22,000 to 31,000 individuals. Its biggest threats are climate change, pollution and energy development. Climate change has caused a decline in sea ice, giving the polar bear less access to its favoured prey and increasing the risk of malnutrition and starvation. Less sea ice also means that the bears must spend more time on land, increasing conflicts with humans. Polar bears have been hunted, both by native and non-native peoples, for their coats, meat and other items. They have been kept in captivity in zoos and circuses and are prevalent in art, folklore, religion and modern culture.

Page: Climate change
Summary: Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth’s climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.
Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.
Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also

I need to find more specific information about the effect of climate change on polar bears.

Observation: Page: Polar bear
Summary: The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas. It is closely related to the brown bear, and the two species can interbreed. The polar bear is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). The species is sexually dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller. The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.
Polar bears are both terrestrial and pagophilic (ice-living) and are considered marine mammals because of their dependence on marine ecosystems. They prefer the annual sea ice but live on land when the ice melts in the summer. They are mostly carnivorous and specialized for preying on seals, particularly ringed seals. Such prey is typically taken by ambush; the bear may stalk its prey on the ice or in the water, but also will stay at a breathing hole or ice edge to wait for prey to swim by. The bear primarily feeds on the seal's energy-rich blubber. Other prey include walruses, beluga whales and some terrestrial animals. Polar bears are usually solitary but can be found in groups when on land. During the breeding season, male bears guard females and defend them from rivals. Mothers give birth to cubs in maternity dens during the winter. Young stay with their mother for up to two and a half years.
The polar bear is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with an estimated total population of 22,000 to 31,000 individuals. Its biggest threats are climate change, pollution and energy development. Climate change has caused a decline in sea ice, giving the polar bear less access to its favoured prey and increasing the risk of malnutrition and starvation. Less sea ice also means that the bears must spend more time on land, increasing conflicts with humans. Polar bears have been hunted, both by native and non-native peoples, for their coats, meat and other items. They have been kept in captivity in zoos and circuses and are prevalent in art, folklore, religion and modern culture.

Page: Effects of climate change on oceans
Summary: There are many effects of climate change on oceans. One of the most important is an increase in ocean temperatures. More frequent marine heatwaves are linked to this. The rising temperature contributes to a rise in sea levels due to the expansion of water as it warms and the melting of ice sheets on land. Other effects on oceans include sea ice decline, reducing pH values and oxygen levels, as well as increased ocean stratification. All this can lead to changes of ocean currents, for example a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The main cause of these changes are the emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities, mainly burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Carbon dioxide and methane are examples of greenhouse gases. The additional greenhouse effect leads to ocean warming because the ocean takes up most of the additional heat in the climate system. The ocean also absorbs some of the extra carbon dioxide that is in the atmosphere. This causes the pH value of the seawater to drop. Scientists estimate that the ocean absorbs about 25% of all human-caused CO2 emissions.     
The various layers of the oceans have different temperatures. For example, the water is colder towards the bottom of the ocean. This temperature stratification will increase as the ocean surface warms due to rising air temperatures.: 471  Connected to this is a decline in mixing of the ocean layers, so that warm water stabilises near the surface. A reduction of cold, deep water circulation follows. The reduced vertical mixing makes it harder for the ocean
